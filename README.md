# Students_Performance_using_Data_Analysis


This project focuses on analyzing student performance data by calculating total scores and determining pass or fail status. It includes data preprocessing and cleaning, followed by the computation of scores from various criteria. The project generates visualizations to provide insights into how different factors such as programs, domains, genders, semesters, and specializations influence student outcomes. To get started, clone the repository, install the required dependencies, and run the analysis script to produce the visualizations and insights.
